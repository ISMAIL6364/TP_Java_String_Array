## Exercise 1: Student Grades Management

### Problem Description
This program reads student grades from the keyboard and stores them in an array.
It allows the following operations:
- Sorting and displaying grades
- Calculating the average grade
- Displaying the highest and lowest grades
- Counting the number of students having a specific grade

### Solution
The grades are stored in an array. The program uses `Arrays.sort()` to sort the grades,
loops to compute the average, and comparisons to find the minimum and maximum values.

### Program Execution
